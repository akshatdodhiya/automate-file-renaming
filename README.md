# Automate file renaming
Automate the boring task of arranging and renaming files in your directory.

## Video Demonstration and Code Explanation:

This program will take 3 inputs:
1) Directory in which the files should be renamed in chronological order.
2) File name in which the names of files are written whose named shouldn't be changed. (Example - except.txt)
3) File extension of the files that should be renamed. (Example - jpg)

The Program then will rename all the files present in that directory from 0 to total number of files present.

The files other than that extension will be capitalized i.e first letter of the name of the file will be made capital.

The files mentioned in except.txt will not be touched which means neither they will be renamed nor capitalized.
